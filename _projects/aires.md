AIRES is a clever new way to help people with their computer problems. It's like having a super-smart assistant that can answer questions and fix issues quickly.

The Big Problem We Solved:
Imagine a busy office where lots of people need help with their computers all the time. It's hard for the IT team to help everyone fast enough. AIRES is our solution to this problem. It can answer simple questions by itself, leaving the human experts free to tackle the trickier issues.

How AIRES Works Its Magic:
AIRES uses some really cool technology to do its job:

- It can understand and respond to emails, phone calls, and even WhatsApp messages.
- It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to figure out what people are asking and how to help them.
- If a problem is too complicated for AIRES, it knows when to ask a human expert for help.

My Role in Creating AIRES:
As the lead tech person on this project, I helped design and build AIRES from start to finish. I made sure all the different parts of AIRES work together smoothly, like a well-oiled machine.

Teamwork Makes the Dream Work:
I worked with three other talented people to create AIRES. Together, we built something that's not just helpful for today, but will change how computer help works in the future.

AIRES is a big step forward in making computer help faster, easier, and smarter for everyone. It's like having a genius IT helper available 24/7!
