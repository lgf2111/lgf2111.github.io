I'm a full-stack developer, optimist, and team player. I currently work as the VP of Product at [Orcus](https://orcusconsulting.com/), where I lead the product team in building and shipping products that help our clients manage their customer orders.

I create educational content for developers, teaching them about full-stack development, FastAPI (Python), Next.js (TypeScript), and more. You can view some of my latest posts below.
